          <p>
            A wave is a pattern that repeats as it travels - a radio signal, a sound, a ripple in
            water. Wavelength is simply the physical length of one full repeat, measured in meters,
            and it depends on how fast the wave travels and how often it repeats.
          </p>
        </ToolSection>

        <ToolSection title="The formula">
          <p className="mono">λ = v / f</p>
          <p>λ is wavelength in meters, v is wave speed in m/s, f is frequency in Hz.</p>
        </ToolSection>

        <LearningDisclosure>
          <ToolSection title="Build it up">
            <p>
              If a wave repeats faster (higher frequency) but travels at the same speed, each repeat has
              to be squeezed into a shorter stretch of space - the wavelength shrinks. If it travels
              faster without repeating any more often, each repeat gets to stretch out further before
              the next one starts - the wavelength grows. Wavelength is speed shared out among however
              many repeats happen per second.

          <Mnemonic tag="λ = v/f" phrase="Faster repeats, shorter waves">
            <p>
              Frequency is on the bottom, so it works against wavelength: crank frequency up and
              wavelength has to come down, for the same wave speed.
