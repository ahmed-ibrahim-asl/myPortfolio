          <p>
            A capacitor blocks steady DC but lets AC through - sort of. It doesn&rsquo;t just let AC
            pass freely; it resists it by an amount that depends on frequency. That
            frequency-dependent resistance is called reactance, and for a capacitor, it goes down as
            frequency goes up.

        <ToolSection title="The formula">
          <p className="mono">Xc = 1 / (2π × f × C)</p>
          <p>Xc is reactance in ohms, f is frequency in hertz, C is capacitance in farads.</p>

            <p>
              A capacitor resists change by storing charge and pushing back. At low frequency, the
              voltage barely changes before the capacitor keeps up - so it blocks current effectively,
              and reactance is high. At high frequency, the voltage is constantly reversing before the
              capacitor can catch up, so more current slips through - reactance drops. A bigger
              capacitor stores more charge for the same voltage swing, so it resists less at any given
              frequency too.

          <Mnemonic tag="Xc = 1 / (2πfC)" phrase="Everything on the bottom, so bigger means lower">
            <p>
              Every quantity that can grow - frequency, capacitance - sits in the denominator. Grow
              either one and reactance has nowhere to go but down.
