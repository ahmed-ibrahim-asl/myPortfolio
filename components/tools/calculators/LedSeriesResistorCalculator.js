          <p>
            An LED has no built-in resistance to speak of - wire one straight to a battery and it
            draws as much current as the supply can give, which is usually enough to destroy it in
            about a second. The series resistor&rsquo;s only job is to eat the extra voltage the LED
            doesn&rsquo;t need, so the current stays at a safe level.

          <ToolSection title="Build it up">
            <p>
              An LED has a fixed forward voltage - the voltage it drops once it&rsquo;s lit, regardless
              of the supply. Whatever voltage is left over from the supply has to be absorbed by
              something else in the loop, or it forces too much current through the LED. That something
              else is the resistor: it drops the leftover voltage while limiting current to whatever the
              LED is rated for.
            </p>
          </ToolSection>

          <Mnemonic phrase="Source minus Forward, over Flow">
            <p>
              Subtract what the LED keeps (its forward voltage) from what the supply gives (source
              voltage), then divide by how much current you want flowing. Leftover voltage, over desired
              flow.
