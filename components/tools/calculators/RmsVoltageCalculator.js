          <p>
            An AC voltage is constantly changing - it doesn&rsquo;t sit at one value the way a battery
            does. RMS voltage is the single steady number that would deliver the exact same heating
            power as that constantly-changing AC signal, which is why it&rsquo;s what gets printed on
            wall sockets instead of the peak voltage.

        <ToolSection title="The formula">
          <p className="mono">Vrms = Vpeak / √2</p>
          <p>Applies to a sine wave. √2 ≈ 1.414.</p>

            <p>
              A sine wave spends most of its time well below its peak - it only touches the very top for
              an instant each cycle. Average the power delivered across the whole cycle (which means
              squaring the voltage, averaging that, then rooting it back - Root Mean Square) and for a
              clean sine wave, the answer always works out to the peak divided by √2.
            </p>
          </ToolSection>

          <Mnemonic tag="÷ √2" phrase="RMS is peak, taken down a notch">
            <p>
              For a sine wave, RMS is always about 70.7% of the peak (1 ÷ √2). Peak-to-peak is just
              double the peak - keep those two divisions straight and the rest follows.
